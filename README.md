# Kush's Pool Calculator
A tool to help you split the cost of time-based services.

The original version of this was written in like 20 minutes. I don't really expect this to used regularly by people I don't know, but I've made it available here (as source code) and as an applet at https://kushagr.net/pool-calc.

I recently rewrote this in Vue.js in order to fix up the messy code and make it generally nicer to work with and potentially expand upon in the future. For example, I am thinking of adding a time picker and showing time overlaps, to make it easy for people to track when people come and go.

Until then, that's all that I'm going to do with this repo for a while.
